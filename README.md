## üçú What is AnimeSnap?
AnimeSnap helps you to identify the anime episode or even timestamp just from a screenshot of any scene from that episode. It uses a powerful trace.moe API to find results. With just a screenshot, you can get:
- The Anime name
- The episode
- The timestamps (start to end) where the scene from the screenshot is shown
  
And much more if you export the results to JSON. It will also show multiple results with the percentage of accuracy.

## üëí Getting Started
It is really easy to use. Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/rohankishore/AnimeSnap/releases), and download the exe file. AnimeSnap is currently available only to Windows machines.

### Building on your own
Download the `main.py` file from the repo, and follow the steps given below:
- Install Pyinstaller [```pip install pyinstaller```]
- Open the terminal and type: ```pyinstaller --onefile -w main.py```

You can use `onedir` too.
